# <span style="color: #2E86C1;">üé® Project Submission Template Creator</span>

## <span style="color: #1ABC9C;">üìò Introduction</span>

This project utilizes REACT and Tldraw library to enable users to create customizable submission templates for others, such as students, to submit their work within designated frames. It's designed to streamline the submission process in educational settings, making it easier for instructors to collect and organize student submissions. While maintaining user's freedom of movement.

Tlextractor is utilized to extract data that the student submitted in this template. See [Tlextractor GitHub Repository](https://github.com/LamJingJie/tlextractor) for more information.

## <span style="color: #E74C3C;">‚ö†Ô∏è Things to Note</span>
- <span style="color: #E74C3C;"><b>Main Frame</b></span>: Do not change the main/outermost frame name, to allow the script to accurately identify which frame to extract.

With this tool, users can specify:

- <span style="color: #27AE60;"><b>Description</b></span>: A brief overview of the submission requirements.
- <span style="color: #27AE60;"><b>Due Date</b></span>: The deadline for submissions.

- <span style="color: #27AE60;"><b>Color Changing</b></span>: Colour in the frames changes depending on submission status.

### <span style="color: #D35400;">üîÑ Conditional Frame Creation</span>

- <span style="color: #E67E22;"><b>More Student Names than Student Amt</b></span>: If the number of names inputted exceeds the specified number of students, the application will create a frame for each name provided, ignoring the "Number of Students" setting.
- <span style="color: #E67E22;"><b>Equal Students Names and Student Amt</b></span>: If the number of names matches the number of students, a frame will be created for each student.
- <span style="color: #E67E22;"><b>Less Student Names than Student Amt</b></span>: When fewer names are provided than the number of students, frames will be created for each name. Subsequent frames without specific names will be assigned default names.
